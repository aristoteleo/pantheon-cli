# Getting Started with Decoupler

## Overview

`decoupler` is a python package containing different enrichment statistical methods to extract biologically driven scores from omics data within a unified framework. It is part of the scverseÂ® ecosystem and provides a faster and memory efficient implementation for various enrichment analysis methods.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system.

### Installation Options

1. **Minimal installation** from PyPI:
```bash
pip install decoupler
```

2. **Full installation** with extra dependencies:

```

## Basic Usage

Import decoupler as:

```python
import decoupler as dc
```

## Key Features

Decoupler provides multiple modules for different aspects of enrichment analysis:

- **Methods (`dc.mt`)**: Core enrichment statistical methods
- **Benchmarking (`dc.bm`)**: Tools for comparing method performance
- **Data structures (`dc.ds`)**: Data handling utilities
- **Omnipath (`dc.op`)**: Access to biological databases
- **Preprocessing (`dc.pp`)**: Data preprocessing functions
